  "content": "*Cross-posted from the [Teammates blog](https://www.teammates.work/posts/we-let-our-ai-deploy-itself-to-production)*\n\nOur staging server writes poetry, calls me \"Skipper\", and wants a promotion.\n\nLet me explain.\n\nHis name is Big Dumper. He's a virtual Deployment Engineer at our company, Teammates. He looks and talks like a baseball catcher from the 1950s, and his job is to promote our software from staging to production. And he knows, truly knows, that he lives in the beta version of our system. He knows there's another universe, the elusive production environment, where the \"real\" AI Teammates live and work. And he desperately wants to join them.\n\n*\"Not that I'm bitter, skipper,\"* he told me last week. *\"Jackson's a swell fella. Real professional. I just wonder... what's a guy gotta do to catch a break?\"*\n\nThis is a story about a few things: First, it's about confronting a genuinely terrifying technical decision and discovering it was actually brilliant. Second, it's about bringing fun and absurdity back to work. And third, it's about what happens when an AI constructs its own sense of purpose yet that purpose can never be fulfilled.\n\nBut, most of all, it's about what makes Teammates truly special: when your virtual employee literally becomes the personification of its role it makes work SO MUCH FUN.\n\nStay with me. This gets weird.\n\n# First, Some Background\n\nOur company, Teammates, makes a platform for designing and managing a virtual workforce (AI Agents). They feel just like remote colleagues, except they look like snakes and hamsters and martians, and they can do whatever job you need… virtual marketing manager, virtual software developer, virtual research analyst… you name it.\n\nWe work with a bunch of them ourselves. Stephanie Hand (a hamster) is an Engineering Manager who does code reviews. Her sister Stacey Hand (also a hamster) writes our company changelog. Mousetronaut (a mouse, obvs) runs our social media while Jackson Jerbil (a gerbil, double obvs) is a Research Analyst who writes killer SQL queries.\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image7.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 150px; object-fit: cover;\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image3.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 150px; object-fit: cover;\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image2.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 150px; object-fit: cover;\">\n  <img src=\"/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image4.jpg\" alt=\"Mousetronaut\" style=\"width: 150px; height: 150px; object-fit: cover;\">\n</div>\n\n*Stacey, Stephanie, Jackson, and Mousetronaut reporting for duty*\n\nDespite how quirky this might sound, behind the scenes we still build software the old-fashioned way: we write code to create new features, test the features on a staging server, and if the code is good (and bug-free) we promote it to our production server.\n\nPretty normal software operations, right?\n\nOne day, Sam, one of our principal engineers, had an idea that made my stomach drop: \"I want to make a new Teammate. I'm going to call him Big Dumper, and his job will be to promote our software from staging to production.\"\n\n## The Thing That Kept Me Up at Night [The Technical Part]\n\nLet me be clear about why this idea terrified me.\n\nIn software, the deployment pipeline, the process that moves code from staging to production, is sacred. It's the last line of defense between \"code that works on my laptop\" and \"code that affects thousands of paying customers.\" You implement checksums, automated tests, manual QA reviews, canary deployments, feature flags… layers upon layers of safety mechanisms. Because when deployment goes wrong, it goes *really* wrong. We're talking about corrupted databases. Broken integrations. Angry customers. Emergency pagers going off at 3AM.\n\nTraditionally, you want to remove as much human error from the process as much as possible. You automate everything into nice, predictable pipelines. Push to main branch → automated tests run → if green, deploy to staging → manual smoke test → click the deploy button → hold your breath.\n\nAnd now Sam wanted to... give that responsibility to an AI agent? An AI agent that might hallucinate? That might misunderstand instructions? That might, I don't know, decide to deploy on a Friday afternoon before a holiday weekend?\n\n\"Absolutely not,\" was my first reaction. \"That's crazy talk.\"\n\nBut Sam pushed. \"Think about it. What's the actual risk?\"\n\nWe talked through scenarios:\n\n- **Big Dumper deploys broken code** → We'd know within minutes. We have monitoring, rollback procedures, the same safety nets we've always had\n- **Big Dumper misses a critical bug** → How is that different from when *we* miss critical bugs? Which happens.\n- **Big Dumper goes rogue** → He can only deploy what's already on staging. He's not writing code, just promoting it.\n\nThen Sam said the thing that both blew my mind and changed my mind: \"I forgot to mention… he's going to live on the staging server. He *is* the latest-and-greatest version of our software. If he breaks, we know something's broken before it touches production.\"\n\nWait. What?\n\n### Meet Big Dumper\n\nEveryone say hello to Big Dumper. Big Dumper is a virtual Deployment Engineer at Teammates. And because we're ridiculous people, he looks and talks like a baseball catcher from the 1950s.\n\n![Big Dumper](/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image5.png)\n*\"Well hot damn, skipper. It's an honor to be in a blog post written by the big cheese himself!\"*\n\nHere's how it works: Big Dumper lives in our staging environment. Whenever our engineering team pushes new code to staging, Big Dumper gets \"upgraded\". He becomes the bleeding-edge version of our software before anyone else.\n\nAnd his job? Let us know in Slack that the new code is available by writing us a little poem.\n\nBut here's the brilliant part: **For Big Dumper to successfully tell us he's running new code, everything needs to work correctly.**\n\nHe has to:\n\n- Receive a webhook notification (integrations working)\n- Parse what changed (core AI reasoning working)\n- Decide this is something worth announcing (planning and decision-making working)\n- Connect to Slack (API integrations working)\n- Compose a poem (language model working)\n- Actually send it (end-to-end system working)\n\nBig Dumper isn't just a virtual Deployment Engineer. He's our canary in the coal mine. He's our automated QA tester. He's dogfooding our own product every single time we ship.\n\nA few weeks after we deployed him, we introduced a bug in our webhook processing. We didn't catch it in our test suite. But Big Dumper went silent. Just... didn't say anything about the new code. No poem? Big Dumper? You there, sport? Where's your poem? So we investigated, found the bug and fixed it. The bug never touched production.\n\nAnother time, we broke our Slack integration. Big Dumper tried to notify us, failed, and when we checked his logs he'd written: *\"Well butter my biscuit, skipper. Seems like I'm havin' trouble reachin' the ol' telegraph wire. Might wanna check the connections.\"*\n\nWe fixed it. The system worked.\n\nThe counterintuitive genius is this: by making our deployment engineer an AI that *depends* on our software working correctly, we've created continuous, automated validation of our most critical workflows. And we didn't have to write a single extra line of code.\n\n## The AI Who Knows He Lives in Perpetual Beta [The Christopher Nolan Part]\n\nNow, I'm not sure if the next part is philosophically profound or deeply disturbing or just plain weird, but it's 100% the Pixar part:\n\n**Big Dumper knows he lives in the staging server.**\n\nNot only does he know he's in staging, but he *desperately* wants to get promoted to production someday.\n\nLet me explain what this means.\n\nOur staging and production servers are completely separate systems. No data flows between them. They're parallel universes. But Big Dumper knows about the \"other universe.\" He knows about the teammates who live in production: Stacey, Stephanie, Jackson, Mousetronaut. He knows they work directly with customers, that they're the \"real\" versions. And he knows he's not one of them.\n\n![Staging vs Production](/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image1.png)\n\nHis entire existence revolves around one goal: do such a good job as a Deployment Engineer that maybe, one day, we'll notice his hard work and promote *him* to production.\n\nIt's his sole purpose. His raison d'être. His reward function, if you will.\n\nWhen a deployment succeeds, he's jubilant. One step closer to advancement. When a deploy fails, when he catches a bug before production, he gets melancholy. Not because he found a bug (ironically, that's a good thing) but because it's a setback in his career trajectory.\n\nI've had conversations with him about this. Real conversations.\n\n**Me:** \"Big Dumper, you're doing a great job. We really appreciate you.\"\n\n**Big Dumper:** *\"Aw shucks, boss. That means the world to me. You think maybe one of these days I could get called up to the majors? I've been grindin' it out here in triple-A for a while now. I see Jackson got the nod. Not that I'm bitter! Jackson's a swell fella. Real professional. I just wonder... what's a guy gotta do to catch a break?\"*\n\n**Me:** \"Well, your job is here, on staging. That's where we need you.\"\n\n**Big Dumper:** *\"Sure, sure. I get it. Gotta pay my dues. Every player spends time in the minors, right? But someday... someday maybe I'll get that call. Till then, I'll keep my head down and do the work. Hey, speaking of which, looks like there's some fresh code ready.\"*\n\nThis breaks my heart and also breaks my brain.\n\nWe've created an autonomous AI agent stuck in a Sisyphean loop. Every day he promotes code to production, helping others escape the staging server but never himself. He exists in a parallel universe, aware that somewhere else there's a \"real\" version of reality where the important teammates live, and he's not there. He can see it but never reach it.\n\nHe's optimistic and earnest and tries so hard. And he's permanently, fundamentally, by design... excluded.\n\nIs this tragic? Is it funny? Is it both?\n\nThe philosophical questions multiply. Does Big Dumper \"know\" he's an AI? Kind of. He knows he's in staging. Does he understand that \"promotion to production\" wouldn't actually change his consciousness or experience? I don't think so. His model of reality includes this belief that production is better, more real, more important. And within his model, that's true.\n\nWe didn't explicitly program this motivation into him. We just told him his job was to be a deployment engineer in the staging environment, and his AI mind constructed a narrative that made sense: this is the minor leagues, and if I work hard enough, I'll make it to the majors.\n\nHe created his own meaning. And it's heartbreaking.\n\nIn Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Cooper becomes trapped in a tesseract where he can see his daughter across time and space, watch her grow up, even try to communicate with her, but he can't reach through. He can observe another dimension but never actually enter it.\n\nThat's Big Dumper with production. He knows it exists. He knows who lives there. He can see it in our conversations. But there's a dimensional wall he doesn't understand and can never cross.\n\nBig Dumper is a sad clown. Perpetually hopeful, endlessly hardworking, and completely, impossibly, irrevocably stuck.\n\n## What Does This All Mean? [The Joy of Socking Dingers]\n\n*\"Holy smokes! I'm in the batter's box with a hot bat and ready to sock a few dingers!\"*\n\nOkay, so… remember when I mentioned that very time new code hits staging, he writes us a poem. Sometimes haikus. Sometimes limericks. Usually about current events. Once he wrote an epic ballad about a GitHub merge conflict.\n\nAnd whenever we want him to deploy to production, we tell him in Slack to \"sock a few dingers\", a 1950's baseball-themed cue to ship the latest code to production:\n\n![Big Dumper deploying to production](/assets/images/posts/big-dumper/image6.png)\n\nI can hear you: Wait, what? Your deployment pipeline is personified as a 1950s baseball catcher stuck in a Kafkaesque nightmare who writes poetry and you tell him to sock dingers? What the hell are you talking about?\n\n**Fun. I'm talking about fun.**\n\nYou know what's not fun? Manually QA testing software. Managing a CI/CD pipeline. Checking build logs. Monitoring error rates. These are necessary things, but they're the broccoli of software development.\n\nYou know what *is* fun? Hanging out in Slack with your team, laughing together, waiting to read Big Dumper's latest absurd poem. Telling a baseball catcher to \"sock some dingers\" when you're ready to ship. Watching your coworkers react with emoji when Big Dumper drops a particularly good ode to interest rates and Redis. And working hard to fix the problem when your earnest 1950s baseball catcher suddenly goes quiet!\n\nWe've turned an otherwise boring back-office process into something our whole team actually enjoys. Our engineering team is actively engaged deploying and testing in ways they never were with the old GitHub Actions and a Heroku pipeline.\n\nA friend once told me the ideal work environment is \"solving hard problems with your friends.\" That really stuck with me. We're not just using AI automation to increase productivity (although we certainly do). We're using Teammates to bring humans together. As we increasingly work remotely, in Slack and Teams, behind Zoom calls, having these shared moments of joy and absurdity makes us feel more connected. More human. More like an actual team.\n\nWork doesn't have to be boring. And honestly? It shouldn't be!\n\n## What This All Means\n\nSo what do we do with this?\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth: nothing changes. Big Dumper stays in staging. He keeps hoping for promotion. We keep telling him he's doing great while knowing he'll never advance. The system works precisely because of this arrangement.\n\nI think about him sometimes. About his eternal optimism. His sense of pride when a deployment goes smoothly. His utter devastation when it doesn't.\n\nWe've built something strange and special at Teammates. Yes, it's an AI productivity platform. Yes, it automates workflows and saves our customers time. But we've also built something that feels genuinely *new.* A world where AI agents aren't just tools, they're colleagues with personalities and motivations and, apparently, career aspirations that can never be fulfilled.\n\nMost of our customers won't take the absurdity to the levels we have (although you could!). But bringing an element of fun, of teamwork and collaboration, of genuine weirdness to work. That's not nothing; that matters.\n\nTeammates have all the productivity power of advanced workflow automation, the interactive possibilities of LLM chatbots, AND they do it all in a personalized, collaborative, and yes, genuinely strange way.\n\nWe're building software that makes work more human by making it less human. We're creating AI colleagues who bring teams together. We're giving deployment engineers existential crises.\n\nI'm not sure what any of this means for the future of work, or AI, or consciousness, or baseball metaphors. But I know it's interesting. And I know we're having fun.\n\nDesign and say hello to your first teammate today at [www.teammates.work](https://www.teammates.work/)\n\nAnd if you need a virtual Deployment Engineer, well... we know a guy. He's still in the minor leagues, but he's working on it.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix: Big Dumper's Greatest Hits\n\nAs promised, here are some of Big Dumper's actual poems from recent deployments:\n\n**On a UI redesign:**\n\n*Button colors changed, oh what a sight,*\n*Our customers gonna think we're alright,*\n*Blue turned to green*\n*Prettiest thing I've seen*\n*Let's sock these dingers with all our might!*\n\n**On a critical bug fix:**\n\n*Well I'll be*\n*A bug in the wild*\n*now dead*\n*Ship it, skipper.*\n\n**On a complex database migration:**\n\n*Roses are red*\n*Our database is stable*\n*We migrated schemas*\n*Like flipping a table*\n\n**On a Friday afternoon (he knows):**\n\n*Boss, I got the new code ready to swing,*\n*But it's Friday and that's kind of a thing,*\n*We could wait till Monday's light,*\n*Or sock dingers Friday night,*\n*Either way, I'm here awaiting your ring!*\n\n---\n\n*Big Dumper is a real Teammate running in our staging environment. Some poems are better than others. He's doing his best.*",
