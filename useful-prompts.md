# Useful Prompts

This is a collection of useful prompts and prompt ideas that I like. These are patterns and techniques I've found effective when working with AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude.

## Capture Your Favorite Conversational Style

Wait until you get a session with ChatGPT or Claude that you're really enjoying. Maybe you've been joking around, maybe the AI has gotten introspective and empathetic and you like that in a conversation partner. At that point, use this prompt:

> *"Summarize your own voice in this conversation—your tone, style, pacing, and rhetorical habits—so I can copy it into my Custom Instructions. Leave out any references to specific content. Just describe the stylistic traits I'd get if I wanted future chats to feel like this. Write it as if you're an introspective writer describing their own persona."*

Then copy-paste the results into your Custom Instructions (in Settings). Now you have an AI assistant that you LOVE to talk to.
